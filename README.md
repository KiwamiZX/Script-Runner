Script Runner
=============

Script Runner is a neon-styled desktop companion for launching automation scripts without leaving a graphical interface. It wraps Python, Bash, PowerShell, and Node.js commands in a modern PySide6 experience: drag a file into the window, tweak arguments with autocomplete, watch live output with inline highlighting, and keep your entire run history searchable.

Highlights
----------

- **Integrated console** - Run scripts in a docked terminal panel with timestamped output, keyword highlighting, and inline command entry.
- **History and logs** - Every run is timestamped, searchable, and one click away from reopening or deleting. Logs live in the sidebar with filters for errors, warnings, and successes.
- **Command templates and autocomplete** - Quick-start snippets for common jobs plus argument autocompletion fed by your recent flags.
- **Interpreter profiles** - Save custom interpreter commands (different Python installs, Node runners, and more) and swap them from the toolbar.
- **Environment aware UI** - Neon dark and crisp light themes, themed scrollbars, centered action buttons, and keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+R run, Ctrl+Shift+R stop, Ctrl+L clear, Ctrl+O browse).
- **Packaging ready** - One PyInstaller command produces a single-file EXE with bundled icon and assets.

### Requirements

- Python 3.10 or newer
- pip / virtual environment (recommended)

### Install dependencies

```
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

At minimum the project depends on PySide6. The virtual environment step keeps the UI runtime isolated from your system Python.

### Launch the app

```
python script_runner.py
```

Drag a `.py`, `.sh`, `.ps1`, or `.js` file onto the window or click **Browse**, adjust arguments, then hit **Run**.

### Keyboard shortcuts

- `Ctrl + R` - Start script
- `Ctrl + Shift + R` - Stop script
- `Ctrl + L` - Clear console
- `Ctrl + O` - Browse for script

Building a Single-File EXE
--------------------------

With the virtual environment activated:

```
pip install pyinstaller
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --icon app_icon.ico --add-data "app_icon.ico;." script_runner.py
```

The executable is created in `dist/script_runner.exe`. The `--add-data` flag keeps the application icon available at runtime; the main window also applies the icon programmatically, so the packaged app shows your branding in the title bar and taskbar.

Project Structure
-----------------

```
runner_app/
  app.py             # QApplication bootstrap
  config.py          # JSON config loading/saving
  highlighting.py    # QTextEdit syntax highlighter
  paths.py           # resource/config/log path helpers
  process.py         # QProcess wrapper with timestamped output
  settings.py        # Settings dialog and interpreter profiles
  ui/
    main_window.py   # Neon UI layout, console, history, logs
    theme.py         # Theme stylesheet builder (dark/light)
script_runner.py     # Entry point (delegates to runner_app.app)
app_icon.ico         # Application icon
requirements.txt     # Python dependencies
```

Logs and configuration files are stored under `%USERPROFILE%\.script_runner`, keeping the workspace clean.

Development Notes
-----------------

- **Themes** - The stylesheet generator handles both dark and light modes, including custom scrollbars, buttons, and dialogs. Toggle the theme in Settings and it will persist between sessions.
- **Autocomplete** - Argument suggestions are seeded with common CLI flags and populated with flags you use. The completer updates automatically whenever a new argument is typed or sent to the console.
- **Profiles and environments** - Settings -> "Save profile" stores interpreter commands (for example, `C:\Python311\python.exe`) with default arguments. You can clear profiles, history, and logs directly from the dialog.
- **History search** - Use the sidebar search box to filter runs by timestamp or filename. Each entry stores the original arguments so you can rerun recurring jobs in one click.

Feel free to open issues or PRs on GitHub if you extend the runner; there is room for more interpreter types, project-specific templates, or integration with task schedulers. Happy scripting!
